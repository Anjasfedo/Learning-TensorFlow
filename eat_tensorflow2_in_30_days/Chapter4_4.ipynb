The Python functions are not able to be embedded into the static graph, so these Python functions are not calculated during the calling after the graph creation; in contras, TensorFlow functions are able to be embedded into the graph.

However, this re-creation of `tf.Variable` only takes place at the first step, i.e. tracing Python code to the create the graph, which is introducing unmatched outputs between the \"eager execution\" before the decoration by `@tf.function` and the \"execution of static graph\" after the decoration by `@tf.function`. In fact, TensorFlow throws error in most of such cases.\n",
