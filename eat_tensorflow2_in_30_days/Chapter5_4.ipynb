This lead to the model adaptive to the various distribution of the input, which is mild regularization that accelerates training. This layer is usually applied before the activation function.\n",

        "- `Conv1D`: Layer of 1D convolutional, usually for text. # of parameters = # of input channels x # of kernel size (e.g. 3) x # of kernels.\n",
        "- `Conv2D`: Layer of 2D convolutional, usually for image. # of parameters = # of input channels x # of kernel size (e.g. 3x3) x # of kernels.\n",
        "- `Conv3D`: Layer of 3D convolutional, usually for video. # of parameters = # of input channels x # of kernel size (e.g. 3x3x3) x # of kernels.\n",
        "- `SaparableConv2D`: Depthwise 2D separable convolution. Unlike the traditional convolutional, separable convolutions consist in first performing a depthwise spatial convolutional (which acts on each input channel saparately) followed by a pointwise convolutional which mixes together the resulting output channels. # of parameters = # of input channels x size of convolutional kernel + # of channels x 1 x 1 x # of output channels. Usually, depthwise separable convolution has a much smaller number of parameters with a better performance.\n",
        "- `DepthwiseConv2D`: Depthwise 2D convolution. Depthwise convolutions consists in performing just the first step in a depthwise separable convolution (which acts on each input channels separately). Usually the # of input and output channels are the same, but can be altered through the `depth_multiplier` argument to control how many output channels are generated per input channel in the depthwise. # of output channels = # of input channels x depth_multiplier. # of input channels x size of kernel x `depth_multiplier`.\n",
        "- `Conv2DTranspose`: 2D Transposed convolution layer (sometimes called Deconvolution), buth this is on the inverse of operation of convolution. When the kernel maintains the same as convolution, and given the input size the same as the output size of convolution, then the output size of the transposed convolution is the same as the input size of convolution.\n",
        "- `LocallyConnected2D`: Locally-connected layer for 2D inputs. This layer works similiary to the `Conv2D` layer, expect that weights are unshared, thus has much more parameter than `Conv2D`.\n",
        "- `MaxPooling2D`: 2D max pooling layer, also called down-sampling layer. This is for reducing dimension without any trainable parameter.\n",
        "- `AverangePooling2D`: 2D averange pooling layer.\n",
        "- `GlobalMaxPool2D`: Global max pooling layer. Only one value preserved for each channel, usually used between convolution layer and fully connected layer, which is subtitution of `Flatten`.\n",

        "- `Embedding`: Embedding layer, provides an encoding with higher efficiency than one-hot for discrite features. It is usually used for projecting input words into dense vectors. Training is required for the parameters in the embedding layer.\n",
        "- `LSTM`: Long Short-Term Memory Layer, which is the most popular layer for the recursive network. It contains carry track and is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate, and a forget gate, which significantly alleviate the problem of gradient vanishing and thus applicable for the problem of long-term dependency. All the middle results could be observed when the parameter `return_sequences` is set as a `True`; in the opposite case only the final result is returned.\n",
        "- `GRU`: Gated Recursive Unit Layer, a simplified version of LSTM without carry track, thus has less parameters and could be trained faster.\n",
        "- `SimpleRNN`: Simple Recursive Neural Network Layer. It is not popular due to the problem of gradient vanishing, which made it inapplicable to the long-dependence.\n",
        "- `ConvLSTM2D`: Convolutional LSTM Layer. Has similiar structure to LSTM but the conversion operation to both input and status are convolution.\n",
        "- `Bidirectional`: Bi-directional wrapper for RNNs, for wrapping layers (such as LSTM and GRU) into bi-directional RNN, enhancing the capability of feature extracting.\n",
        "- `RNN`: Base classes of RNN. It accepts an RNN cell or a list of RNN cells. and iterate on the sequence to convert the input as an RNN through the calling of `tf.keras.backend.rnn` function.\n",
        "- `LSTMCell`: LSTM Cell. Unlike iterating across the whole sequence as `LSTM`, it only iterate once the sequence. It would be more intuitive to understand the LSTM equals to `LSTMCell` wrapped by the base layer `RNN`.\n",
        "- `GRUCell`: GRU Cell. Unlike iterating across the whole sequences as `GRU`, it only iterate once on the sequence.\n",
        "- `SimpeleRNNCell`: SimpleRNN Cell. Unlike iterating across the whole sequence as `SimpleRNN`, it only iterate once on the sequence.\n",
        "- `AbstractRNNCell`: Abstract RNN Cell. It allows user to customize RNN through inheritance and subsequently construct the RNN layer through wrapping these RNN cells by RNN base layer.\n",
        "- `Attention`: Dot-product attention layer, a.k.a. Luong-style attention, for constructing attention model.\n",
        "- `AdditiveAttention`: Additive attention layer, a.k.a. Bahdanau-style attention, for constructing attention model.\n",
